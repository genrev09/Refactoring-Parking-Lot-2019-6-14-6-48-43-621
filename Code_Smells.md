Below are the code smells I found on my code during refactoring.

Dead Code:
- I've found a lot of dead code on my test. I refactored it by removing the declaration of variable.

Comments:
- I found a comment on my test. I refactored by removing the unnecessary comment.

Primitive Obsession:
- There are a lot of strings. I converted them to constant.

Long Method:
- There are a lot of methods that has complex logic. I just created another method that does the other logic.

Duplicate Code:
- There are some duplicate codes. I just created another method that can be reused.
